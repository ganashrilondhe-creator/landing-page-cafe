## 📌 Overview

Café Reserve simulates a real-world café booking experience. Customers can explore the café, submit table reservations, and receive email updates on their booking status — all through a clean, intuitive interface. On the backend, café staff manage reservations through a dedicated admin dashboard, accepting or rejecting bookings with a single click.

This project was built to demonstrate end-to-end full-stack development: from a polished customer-facing UI to a functional admin panel with email automation.

## 📧 How the Reservation System Works

```
Customer fills out reservation form
         ↓
Reservation stored & sent to Admin Dashboard
         ↓
Admin reviews the request
    ┌────┴────┐
  Accept     Reject
    ↓           ↓
Confirmation  Rejection
  email sent   email sent
    ↓           ↓
Customer notified via email
```

1. **Customer** submits the reservation form with their name, date, time, and party size
2. **Admin** sees the request appear in the dashboard
3. **Admin** accepts or rejects the booking
4. **Customer** receives an automated email reflecting the decision
